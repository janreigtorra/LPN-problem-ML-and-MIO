# Solving the Learning Parity with Noise Problem using ML and MIO

Ideated a new Mix-Integer Optimization formulation and implemented tree-based methods to solve the Learning Parity with Noise problem.

In this project, you can find a new way to solve the LPN problem using ML techniques and an MIO approach that beats the Brute force algorithm in terms of accuracy. The code is in Julia.
